<p align="center"><strong>The first Clarity static analyser that finds bugs in your smart contracts


Main Launch: https://www.gecko.security/ (Mid July)


### What is Gecko?
Gecko is an open-source Clarity static analysis tool written in Rust. It currently detects two vulnerabilities: unsafe inputs and authentication via `tx-sender`. When it finds these vulnerabilities, Gecko provides visual information about the bug. It also features a web UI for easy contract testing. Developers can upload and test their own contracts or input deployed contracts for Gecko to scan. This makes it useful for both pre and post-deployment testing. Gecko helps developers find vulnerabilities and improve their code comprehension. Additionally, it reassures users that the deployed contracts they interact with are safe.

### Features
Currently Gecko only supports checking for unsafe inputs and for vulnearbilities that occur when `tx-sender` is used for authentication. These were chosen as they were the most common vulnearbilities that can be found in clarity contracts see this [report](https://www.coinfabrik.com/blog/tx-sender-in-clarity-smart-contracts-is-not-adviced/). The full list of vulnerabilities that will be added can be found [here](https://github.com/Gecko-Security/Gecko-Clarity/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vulnerability-detectors). 

### How Gecko's Static Analysis Works
1. We parse the Clarity code into a structure that Gecko can understand, this is called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It represents the hierarchical structure of the code. We use the [Clarity Contract Analysis Crate](https://docs.rs/stacks-codec/latest/stacks_codec/clarity/vm/analysis/types/struct.ContractAnalysis.html), which converts Clarity code into an AST and other metadata. This is the main entrypoint for Gecko.
2. We then define a struct called [Gecko](https://github.com/Gecko-Security/Gecko-Clarity/blob/main/static/static/src/main.rs#L52), which implements the [`ast_visitor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/visit/trait.Visitor.html) crate used to traverse each node and understand the behaviour of the code.
3. Taint analysis is used to track the flow of potentially unsafe data through the program and locate bugs and vulnearbilities. This involves defining the vulnearbility detectors as invariants and tracking the data to ensure it is properly checked or sanitized.
4. As Gecko traverses the tree it propagates this taint to other nodes that depend on these.
5. Once the traversal is complete messages are displayed about issues found including the location of the bug in source.

###  Vulnerability Detectors
The following is a table of vulnearbility detectors supported by Gecko and future detectors that will be added when as the AST is impoved and dynamic analysis such as fuzzing is added. 

The aim is to create a set of real-life vulnearbilities and examples that will not only serve as a robust development template but also help identify good and bad parctices in Clarity contract development. Contibution of adding new vulnearbilities or examples is welcome.

The runtime error does not allow the caller to handle that error and act in response.
